CRD to allow dynamic namespace selector in server authorizations, somewhat
implementing https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/9419

After making changes to the API under `api/v1alpha1`, regenerate manifest:

```
make generate manifests
```

To install the CRD:

```
kubectl kustomize config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
```

To run the controller locally:

```
make run
```
